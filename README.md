# 👋 Hi, I'm Seunggyu Lee

I'm an undergraduate researcher at **Korea Aerospace University (KAU)** majoring in **Aerospace Engineering**.  
My work lies at the intersection of **robotics, autonomy, and language-based reasoning**, where I explore how **large language models (LLMs)** can enhance the **planning and adaptability of autonomous robotic systems**.

---

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Leveraging **LLMs/VLMs** for reasoning and decision-making in autonomous systems  
- **Mission allocation** and cooperative control for multi-UGV teams  
- **Simulation and optimization** for aerial/ground robotics platforms  

---

## 🧩 Projects & Research

### 🤖 On-Device Vision-Language-Model based Robot Behavior Planning Framework
- Led a team of six to design a **VLM-based autonomous robot architecture** deployable on Jetson Orin NX/Nano.  
- Mitigated hallucination via an **LLM-based actor–critic validation loop** and rule-based pre-filter.  
- Implemented **SLAM**, **object detection**, and **ROS 2 Nav2** navigation stack.  
- 🏆 *Encouragement Award*, 7th National Undergraduate Capstone Design Competition (SASE, 2025).  
- Presentation Poster(Korean):

### 🚜 Multi-UGV Simulation Environment
- Built a simulation environment to evaluate mission allocation algorithms for multiple UGVs.  
- Using ROS2 and Gazebo for simulation, with Python for testing and implementation. 

---

### ✈️ Ducted-Fan VTOL Platform
- Designed and validated a **custom ducted-fan VTOL rig** instrumented with high-precision sensors.  
- Developed a **MATLAB + DAQ** pipeline for thrust/torque data acquisition and analysis, achieving 10 cm position accuracy.
